	<br>
	<center> <h3>Our ISP, known as The Cafe Project, is a project to help increase the efficiency of not only the students grabbing their lunches, but also the employees of the lunch lines, and the chefs. Our project will consist of an applicaion that students can use to preorder their lunch, and be able to pick it up at a specific time, depending on the availability, the traffic of students, and the amount of food the restaurants have ready. Students will also be able to preorder specifc meals hours ahead, to enable them to be able to get their food on time, and to be able to eat whatever they want, without having to worry about outside factors, such as finding a table, or having enough time to get to class on time. Overall, The Cafe Project will help Allen Highschool Students on getting their food in time, as well as helping the kitchens, being able to know how much food they need to make prior to cooking it, and losing the risk of running out of food some days.</h3> </center>
