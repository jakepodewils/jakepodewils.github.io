	  <p>Timothy Andressen's School Bus GPS System was truly a pretty decent proposal that I ended up considering in my final 10. Overall, the only reason I decided to decline this proposal was because I could not imagine that the routes with no red lights and stop signs would be faster than roads with lights. Also, what if there are no posible routes with no stops? Ultimately, all of these questions and wonderings caused me to eliminate this out of my final 10, and reject this proposal.</p>
	  <a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/sophie-hews/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html">2: Sophie Hews Recipe Creator</a>
	  <p>Sophie Hews Recipe Creator was an incredibly beneficial program at first, and I was truly shocked about how great of an idea it was. However, as I thought about it more, I was confused on how it was going to make that much money, and whether it was a profitable business or not. As well as the money situation, I was also wondering if there were already apps that could do things like this, and how fast and easy it would be to input products that could be used to make a recipe. As well as speed, how would portions work, and what if they gave you a recipe ut you don't have enough portions? I feel as if this could be an incredibly beneficial program, but it would have to be paired with another program that could detect what you buy from the store, and what you input into your fridge or your pantry. Overall, all of these reasons led me to have to reject this proposal.</p>
	  <a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/muqadam-sabir/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html">3: Muqadam Sabir's Skyward Improvements</a>
	  <p>Muqadam Sabir's Skyward Improvements was truly not the greatest idea out of all of these options. For one, I personally don't experience any of these problems that was stated within the proposal. As well as the problems not existing, I don't think making a new grading program that could only be partially better would be worth it, as all schools that use skyward would have to transfer over to this new grading system, and pay even more money to even get the grading service for their school. All of these reasons ultimately led me to decide to reject this proposal.</p>
	  <a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/andrew-eldridge/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-III/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html">4: Andrew Eldridge's Screen Privacy Camera<a>
	      <p>Andrew Eldridge's Screen Privacy Camera is truly a pretty decent idea, with a bold plan, and a wild idea. Overall, I was a little confused on how they were going to sell this camera, and how they would even create facial recognition in the first place. What happens if the camera encounters a poster with a face on it, or maybe even a face cutout used at spots games. As well as facial recognition problems, having a product that would ship out to people could induce many more problems as well, such as design flaws, easily breaking, etc. Overall, all of these flaws and confusions ultimately led me to decline this proposal.</p>
	      <a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/connor-church/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html">5: Connor Church's Drowsiness Detector</a>
	      <p>Connor Church's Drowsiness Detector was a decent idea, but I was incredibly confused on the execution. Is this product a camera that you could put on a desk or a dashboard? What if the human gets shocked, and swerves into traffic? What if the facial recognition repeatedly shocks the person because it thinks the person is drowsy? How costly would this become for schools? All of these questions and confusions ultimately led me to decide to reject this proposal, due to it being too confusing.</p>
	      <a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/austin-dlugosch/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html">6: Austin Dlugosch's 360 Degrees Rotating TV</a>
	      <p>Austin Dlugosh's 360 Degrees Rotating TV is a very interesting idea, that solves a very interesting problem. Overall, this product at first glance seemed decently useful, for angling the TV any way you want, to suit all viewers. Unfortunately, most solutions also come with another problem. For one, how would cable management work? Would the cables wrap around the TV if you did a full 360? As well as the cable management problem, the more I thought about it, the more I realized that it was unhelpful, and useless. Ultimately, all of these problems that arose during my research led me to decide to reject this proposal.</p>
	      <a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/ishita-chowdhury/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-III/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html">7: Ishita Chowdhury's Music Recognition</a>
	      <p>Ishita Chowdhury's Music Recognition was a decently smart idea, but has many flaws. For one, how would one profit off of this business? If you make them pay for the recognition, nobody would buy it, because there are better, free versions out there that people could use. As well as the economy problem, I also discovered that this proposal did not have much information on to what this product truly was, and it, infact, had no proposal. Overall, this lack of proposal was the reason that I did not accept this proposal, and infact reject it</p>
	      <a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/george-winters/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html">8: George Winter's Computer Science Social Media Network</a>
	      <p>George Winter's Computer Science Social Media Network was an incredibly good idea, for the most part. Overall, the only problem I recognized on this social media network was profit, and how they were going to make money. If they make a subscription, many people might not join this network, due to there being other social media networks that could work as the same product, but free. Overall, for all of these reasons, this is why I am rejecting this proposal.</p>
	      <a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/caysen-mayo/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html">9: Caysen Mayo's Unity Game</a>
	      <p> Caysen Mayo's Unity Game is a decent idea, that can attract people just like me; people that like to play video games. However, this game lacks many key components. For one, it lacks a good, creative, and special idea. This game is a lot like many other games and products that are already created. This game would not be able to get much attention, because there are already other games that do the same thing. As well as this problem, economy and profit would also be incredibly hard, because people would not like to pay for a game or service that they could rather just get for free, and better quality. These reasons were the ultimate dealbreaker for me, and this is why I am rejecting this proposal.</p>
	      <a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/andrewm-lin/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html">10: Andrew Lin's Cafeteria Manager</a>
	      <p>Andrew Lin's Cafeteria Manager was an incredibly smart idea. For one, I loved how smart this solution was, and how well it fixes the problem. Another reason I considered this proposal was how this program was able to solve a problem that I have with the Allen Highschool Lunches. I also loved how well this proposal was made, and how professional it looked. Overall, for these reasons, I have decided to accept this proposal, and join in on this great adventure!</p>
