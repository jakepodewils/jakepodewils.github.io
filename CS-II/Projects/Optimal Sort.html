  <h2>In the google sheet, you can see our time for every RUN we did. We tested our speed 10 times, and every test, we tested the run 5 times, and calculated the time average. After we calculated each tests' average time to complete, we added all of the tests together, and calculated the final time average over the course of the tests.</h2>
  <h1>Hypothesis </h1>
  <h3>Overall, the factors that induce the amount of time it takes to code solely depends on the code, and how many times the program has to make a calculation, as well as the amount of items inside of the list.</h3>
